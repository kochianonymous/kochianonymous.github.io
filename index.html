      <p>nterview experience : It was Technical plus Manegerial interview.
Video conferencing was conducted in my college for
this round. I was asked questions like Tell me about
yourself, What is an IP address, what is DHCP, what
are the layers in an OSI model, difference between
IPV4 and IPV6, difference between linear and non
linear data structure, LIFO and FIFO, my project, my
strengths, and if i had any relocation problem. They
checked my confidence when I could not answer but
this round went well.</p>
